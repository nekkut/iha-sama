Split into three major categories Quality, Development and users

Quality
Visuality appeals to users
Usability makes usage comfortable

Simplicity means that there are no visual disturbances on the screen, like a frame having twitter posts

Accessibility means that the page is designed so that people with constraints are able to use it,
like choosing the colors so that color blind people are able to use it properly

Intuitive actions means that what the user expects to happen, happens. If you press a button, it
does an intuitive thing. This means that signifiers have to be good, and the navigation should be
easy so that you end up where you want to when you click on something

The other two major categories are Development and Users. Conceptualizing is a part of development
and it leads to testing. The users participate in those tests. After testing, you get feedback. 
With testing and feedback, you can adapt the development cycle, and improve the web site.

The users also have demands related to quality and constraints. I could almost draw a line from demands
to quality, but it would mess this diagram a bit.
